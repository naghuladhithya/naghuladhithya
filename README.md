# 👋 Hi there, I'm Naghul Adhithya

I'm a **high school senior** and **researcher** exploring the deep structure of reality through **computer science**, **machine learning**, **mathematics**, and **physics**.

My work bridges **rigorous theory** with **real-world application**, with a focus on **large language models (LLMs)** and **computer vision**. I’m driven to build systems that **learn**, **adapt**, and **push the boundaries** of artificial and human intelligence.

### 💻 Life as Code

> I see life as a recursive program—layered with hidden logic and emergent behaviors.  
> Every obstacle is a bug to debug, every insight a patch, and growth an ongoing optimization loop.  
> The `quit()` function is disabled. Progress is inevitable.
